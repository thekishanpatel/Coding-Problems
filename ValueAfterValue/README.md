Given an array, starting from the beginning of the array till it’s end, whenever you encounter the number ‘2’, add another ‘2’ just after it. In doing so, the last element in the array would be removed, because the final array should be the same size as the initial one. For example, if the initial array is [23, 2, 3, 12, 2, 2, 34, 55, 66, 79], then the modified array should be [23, 2, 2, 3, 12, 2, 2, 2, 2, 34]. Expected time complexity is O(n) and you should do it in place (using only constant amount of extra memory).
